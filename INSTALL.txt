Warning:
Some distros, like OpenSUSE 11.2 disabled IPv6 support inside python. This
support must be enabled for this program to work correctly. Instructions on
how to enable this support is distribution specific and is not detailed here.

In order to test if our python distribution has IPv6 support, you can write
these lines in an interactive python shell:
$ import socket
$ socket.has_ipv6

Dependencies:

The lib netfilter queue's binding in python. On Debian or Ubuntu:
$ apt-get install nfqueue-bindings-python

However, I recommend using the tip of the latest git version when possible:
$ git clone http://git.inl.fr/git/nfqueue-bindings.git

A modified version of scapy6, including CGA address & SEND messages support
is required. It is shipped with this software in the directory scapy6send.

You can manually install the software by executing in the source directory:
$ python setup.py install

An examples/ directory contains example of configuration file for the
implemantation. The configuration files are fully commented.


Please note that if you want to use X.509 IP address extension verification
inside the certificates (x509_ipextension set to true in your configuration
file), you need to have an OpenSSL library compiled with the
RFC3779 support.

You can do that on Debian by recompiling the OpenSSL package:

$ apt-get source libssl0.9.8 # or the corresponding version
$ cd openssl-0.9.8g
$ vim debian/rules # add "enable-rfc3779" to the relevant line
$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot # be patient
$ cd ..
$ # and this is it
$ sudo  dpkg -i libssl0.9.8_0.9.8g-16ubuntu3.1_i386.deb

On Gentoo, it is simplier, there is an "rfc3779" use flag on the
dev-libs/openssl package.


Once the program is installed (via the setup.py or via a distribution specific
package) you can copy either sendd.conf.host or sendd.conf.router from the
/usr/share/doc/ndprotector to /etc/NDprotector/sendd.conf. Then modify the
config file to suite your needs.
For a basic configuration, you only need to take care of the following variables:
NDprotector.default_publickey
NDprotector.trustanchors
NDprotector.certification_path
