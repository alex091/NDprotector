Starting with NDprotector 0.4, there is a functionality to add plugins to the
implementation. Currently the work is ongoing and should not be used. At some
points, it should provide entrypoint in the code to add some function call and
such to modify the behavior of the implementation.

Only one functional plugin is embedded with this version of the code:
Ephemeral CGA. It was developed for a research purpose. You should probably
not use it.

Plugin are tagged with categories that determines which entrypoint should be
used for the plugin.

A plugin may be classified in multiple categories.
These categories can be:
- NFQueue: implements a specific queue
- Filtering: Add/suppress filtering rules
- NeighborCache: modifies the behavior of the neighbor cache


Might be implemented at a later time:
- WarnOutput: modify the output warning
